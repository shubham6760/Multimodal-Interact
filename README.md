###Local Multimodal AI Chat
Overview
Local Multimodal AI Chat is an immersive project designed to delve into the development of a multimodal chat application. With a focus on integrating various AI models to handle audio, images, and PDFs within a unified chat interface, this project offers invaluable hands-on experience for enthusiasts interested in AI and software development.

The primary objective of this project is experiential learning, where participants witness the seamless integration of different components such as Whisper AI for audio processing, LLaVA for image analysis, and Chroma DB for PDF interactions. While detailed tutorials on creating this repository are available on my YouTube channel, this project remains a work in progress, open to contributions and improvements.

Features
Quantized Model Integration: This application utilizes "quantized models," optimized for regular consumer hardware, ensuring efficient performance without requiring high-end computing resources.

Audio Chatting with Whisper AI: Leveraging Whisper AI's transcription capabilities, this application delivers a sophisticated audio messaging experience, enhancing conversational flow and user engagement.

Image Chatting with LLaVA: LLaVA, a refined version of LLaMA, enables effective interpretation of image embeddings using a CLIP model, enriching the interactive experience within the chat application.

PDF Chatting with Chroma DB: Integrating Chroma DB as a vector database enables seamless interaction with PDF files, facilitating comprehensive analysis and dialogue with text content.
